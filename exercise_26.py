# Write a Python program to create a Caesar encryption
# Note : In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques.
# It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.
# For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on.
# The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.
# plaintext:  defend the east wall of the castle
# ciphertext: efgfoe uif fbtu xbmm pg uif dbtumf
